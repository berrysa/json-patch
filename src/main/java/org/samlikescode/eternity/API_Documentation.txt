INFINITY: A dynamic RESTful data store managed entirely through HTTP APIs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Infinity is the cosmic entity that defines the entirety of space and its occupants." - Marvel Wiki //todo: get a quote from one of the Infinity comics

--------
OVERVIEW
--------
Infinity is built on the philosophy that any client should be able to customize and manage data without interruption or downtime. Infinity accomplishes
this goal by offering an API with a set of consistent standards that follow RESTful principles. Creating, updating, and deleting of models can be done
via HTTP requests with immediate results. Managing model data is predictive and consistent. Retrieving data can be broad or precise. Discovery is encouraged,
any information provided in this document should be acquirable through the API.

The Infinity API itself is dynamic providing consumer specific URIs for managing data. For every model there is a URI. Every model can be filtered by any of
it's attributes with the same rule applying to it's attributes' attributes--and so on.

DEFINITIONS
    - model: The definition of a supported representation. Can be thought of as a "table" definition. The accepted input and return structure
             of a set(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28mathematics%29#Describing_sets) of information that relates to a common meaning.
             //todo important to URI syntax. link to suggested data modeling strategies.
    - model data: data inside of a single model. Ex: the Profile model has 1k representations. Each unique representation is model data. The same term
                  applies to collections of model data, because modal datas has a squiggly under it.
    - being: a unique user of Infinity, likely an application or service.

-------------------
REGISTERING A BEING
-------------------
// currently incomplete and subject to change
In order to authenticate and send requests to Infinity one must be registered as a being. Registering as a being of Infinity can be accomplished through
the /beings resource and should only need to be done once.
    1. Request a permanent auth token
        REQUEST:
            POST /infinity/beings
            {
                "username": String  <- Required. Will be used as the context root for all models of the being.
            }
        RESPONSE:
            201
            Headers: [{key: "Location", value: "/infinity/beings/{username}"]
            {
                "token": String     <- This token is required to authenticate any request under /beings/{username}
            }

--------------------
CREATING A NEW MODEL
--------------------
    Models are used to keep collections of representations a consistent structure. The consistency of representations under a common resource provides
    predictable extensibility and a reliable system. URIs are based on the structure of models and the names of their attributes. The Infinity API will use
    these descriptions to validate incoming requests. The API can validate requiredness and format (via REGEX) of any
    field.

    Conditional validation such as, "Field A is required if field B is present", or any other implementation specific validation outside of the capabilities
    of REGEX must be enforced by the implementer. Validation is meant to provide length and character protection.

    Models are created through the /models resource.

    DEFINING A MODEL
        A model is defined by a name and a collection of fields.

        STRUCTURE
            Ex:
                POST /infinity/models
                {
                    "name": "profile",
                    "fields": [
                        {
                            "field": "name",
                            "type": "object",
                            "fields": [
                                {
                                    "field": "first",
                                    "required": true,
                                    "regex": "^\w"
                                }
                                {
                                    "field": "first",
                                    "required": false,
                                    "regex": "^\w"
                                },
                            ]
                        },
                        {
                            "field": "email",
                            "required": true,
                            "regex": "^[_a-z0-9-]+(\.[_a-z0-9-]+)*@[a-z0-9-]+(\.[a-z0-9-]+)*(\.[a-z]{2,4})$"
                        },
                        {
                            "field": "favoriteShoe",
                            "required": false,
                        },
                        {
                            "field": "shoeSize",
                            "required": false,

                        },
                        {
                            "field": "shoes",
                            "required": true,
                            "type": "collection",
                            "member": {
                                "type": "object",
                                "fields": [
                                    {
                                        "field": "brand",
                                        "required": true,
                                        "regex": "^\w$"
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "field": "size",
                                        "required": true,
                                        "type": "number"
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            "field": "active",
                            "required": true,
                            "type": "boolean"
                        }
                    ]
                }

        NAME
            The name of a model is used for identification in future requests. The name provided will be pluralized non-intelligently (appending 's') and a
            resource will be created at the root of Infinity. Ex: if a "cheese" model is added, an operable resource at /infinity/cheeses is created.

        FIELDS
            Fields define the complete structure of a model. Fields can be flagged as required and constraints can be applied via REGEX. No further validation
            is offered.

            STRUCTURE
                {
                    "field": String,        <- Required. Identifies the name of the field.
                    "type": String,         <- Optional. Defines the type of the field. Default: "string".
                    "required": Boolean,    <- Optional. Is the field required. Default: false.
                    "regex": String,        <- Optional. A REGEX expression to apply to string types (ignored for all other types) for validation. Default: null.
                    "fields": Array,        <- Required if type is "object", ignored otherwise. Defines validation of inner fields for a subordinate object. Default: null.
                    "member": Object        <- Required if type is "collection", ignored otherwise. Defines validation for the collection's members. Default: null.
                }

            ATTRIBUTES
                The available attributes for specifying fields.

                FIELD
                    A required attribute that defines the name of the field.

                TYPE
                    An optional "type" attribute is available to describe fields. Unless otherwise specified, the rules described in FIELDS STRUCTURE
                    apply to all field types. Supported types are:
                        - string (default)
                        - collection
                        - object
                        - boolean
                        - number

                    STRING
                        The string type identifies a field as being a String. This is the default type if none is specified. REGEX validation
                        can be applied to string fields.

                        STRUCTURE
                            {
                                "field": String,    <- Required. Identifies the name of the field.
                                "type": "string",   <- Optional. Identifies the type as a string. This is redundant and unnecessary since it is the default type.
                                "regex": String     <- Optional. Defines an expression to apply on all incoming representations to determine if it is valid or not. Default: null.
                            }

                            Ex: An email field with validation.
                            {
                                "field": "email",
                                "regex": "^[_a-z0-9-]+(\.[_a-z0-9-]+)*@[a-z0-9-]+(\.[a-z0-9-]+)*(\.[a-z]{2,4})$"
                            }

                            Ex: An email field without validation.
                            {
                                "field": "email"
                            }

                    COLLECTION
                        The collection type identifies a field as an array of representations. If a field is labeled as a collection,
                        it's member structure must be defined.

                        STRUCTURE
                            {
                                "field": String,        <- Required. Identifies the name of the field.
                                "type": "collection",   <- Required. Identifies the type as a collection of representations.
                                "required": Boolean,    <- Ignored. Not sure how to handle this yet, or what a required collection would mean / how it would be enforced.
                                "member": {             <- Required. Defines the structure of the collection's members.
                                    "type": String,     <- Required. See supported types. Does not support "collection" (nested collections).
                                    "regex": String,    <- Optional. A REGEX expression to apply to string types for validation. Default: null.
                                    "fields": Array,    <- Required if type is "object". Defines validation of inner fields for a subordinate object. Default: null.
                                }
                            }

                            Ex: A collection of objects.
                                {
                                    "field": "favorites",
                                    "type": "collection",
                                    "member": {
                                        "type": "object",
                                        "fields": [
                                            {
                                                "field": "description",
                                                "required": true,
                                                "regex": "^.{50}$"
                                            }
                                        ]
                                    }
                                }

                            Ex: A collection of strings.
                                {
                                    "field": "favorites",
                                    "type": "collection",
                                    "member": {
                                        "type": "string",
                                        "regex": "^.{50}$"
                                    }
                                }

                    OBJECT
                        The object type defines a field as an object with inner fields. If a field is labeled as an object, it's fields
                        must be defined.

                        STRUCTURE
                            {
                                "field": String,    <- Required. Identifies the name of the field.
                                "type": "object",   <- Required. Identifies the field as an object.
                                "fields": [...]     <- Required. Defines each field of the object. See FIELD STRUCTURE.
                            }

                    BOOLEAN
                        The boolean type defines a field as a boolean value.

                        STRUCTURE
                            {
                                "field": String,        <- Required. Identifies the name of the field.
                                "type": "boolean",      <- Required. Identifies the field as a boolean.
                            }

                            Ex: An active field.
                                {
                                    "field": "active",

                                }

                    NUMBER
                        The number type defines a field as a numeric value. Supports decimal values.

                        STRUCTURE
                            {
                                "field": String,        <- Required. Identifies the name of the field.
                                "type": "number",      <- Required. Identifies the field as a number.
                            }

                            Ex: An age field.
                                {

                                }

                            Ex: A birthday field (timestamp as millis).
                                {
                                    "field": "birthday",

                                }

                            Ex: A price field.
                                {
